        <h2>Prologue: A Played Nation</h2>
        <p>In the stillness of dawn, long before the polling stations opened and the nation queued in hope, I stood not
            just as a voter, but as a son of the soil—betrayed, hopeful, wounded, and awake. Kenya was not just a
            homeland; it was a performance stage, and we, its people, the unsuspecting cast in a tragic play. The ballot
            box promised change, but the script was written elsewhere—inked in boardrooms, brokered in shadows, and
            rehearsed by men whose hands never knew the weight of hunger or the sting of unemployment.</p>

        <p>This book is not a political manifesto. It is a mirror. A poetic memoir of a nation that danced in circles
            while its youth lost direction. It is my story, but also yours—of dreams raised by promises and dashed by
            power games. It is a lament for every schoolchild sent home for fees, for every graduate locked out by
            systems designed to fail them, for every election whose results were known long before we queued.</p>

        <p><em>A Played Nation</em> is a cry for truth and a tribute to resilience. I write as a witness, as a voice for
            the forgotten, as a young man who crossed borders chasing a better future—but never left behind the burden
            of his country’s broken promises.</p>

        <p>This is not just about what was done to us. It is a call to what we must become.</p>
